# Character
Handles both Player character and NPC movement/behavior.

1. Scripted custom sound-based footsteps system based on material player/NPC is walking on
2. Disabled space bar for jumping. Jumping occurs when player walks/runs off a ledge automatically using frame-by-frame Blockcasting.
3. Scripting custom sprint and crouch systems. Crouching also prevents jumping upon walking off a ledge.
4. Scripting a rolling system that mitigates fall damage if you roll at the frame you hit the ground after falling from a ledge.

I'm sorry the video frames-per-second is so terrible. If you'd like to briefly playtest the game yourself, I invite you to give it a try at:
